## Architecture

Discuit is built with the following components:

- **Backend**: Developed in Go, it handles the core functionality of the application. It consists of modules like authentication, database interactions, and API endpoints.

- **Frontend**: Developed in React, it provides the user interface for interacting with the platform. It includes components for browsing content, user profiles, and community interactions.

- **Database**: MariaDB is used as the main datastore for Discuit. It stores user data, community information, and other application-related data.

- **Transient Data Store**: Redis is utilized for transient data storage, such as caching frequently accessed data and managing session information.

The project directory structure is organized into the following main directories:

- `cli`: Contains the command-line interface.
- `core`: Contains core functionality of the backend.
- `internal`: Contains Go packages internal to the project.
- `migrations`: Contains SQL migration files.
- `server`: Houses the REST API backend.
- `ui`: Contains the React frontend.
